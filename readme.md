Welcome to my dotfiles repository! ðŸŒ±

These are my personal config files that keep my computing life organized. They might not be perfect, but they make my digital space feel like home.
Roam around and use anything you find helpful.

Let me know if something's wrong and remember: suggestions are always welcome! ðŸ“¬
